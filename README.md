# Financial Risk for Loan Approval

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting financial risk associated with loan approvals. Using the "Financial Risk for Loan Approval" dataset from Kaggle, we aim to build predictive models that can assess the likelihood of loan approval based on various applicant attributes. The dataset includes diverse features such as demographic information, credit history, employment status, income levels, existing debt, and other relevant financial metrics, providing a comprehensive foundation for sophisticated data-driven analysis and decision-making.
